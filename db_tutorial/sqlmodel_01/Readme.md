# Introduction to SQL Model

This Python application utilizes SQLModel with a PostgreSQL database to manage a table of heroes, each with a unique identifier, name, secret identity, and an optional age attribute.

## Configuration

The application attempts to load the database configuration from a `.env` file. If this file is not found, it defaults to a standard configuration. The `DATABASE_URL` is expected to be in the `.env` file, which is then parsed and modified to fit the PostgreSQL connection string format required by the database driver.

## Database Model

The `Hero` class defines the structure of the heroes table in the database. It includes fields for the hero's ID, name, secret name, and age.

## Database Operations

The application defines functions to interact with the database:
- `create_db_and_tables()`: Sets up the database tables based on the SQLModel definitions.
- `add()`: Adds a new hero instance to the database.
- `update(id: int)`: Updates the details of an existing hero in the database.
- `delete(id: int)`: Removes a hero from the database.

## Usage

To use the application:
1. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database accessible and the `.env` file configured with the `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Run the script to create the database tables.
3. Use the `add`, `update`, and `delete` functions to manage heroes in the database.


## Example

Here's how you can add a new hero to the database:

```python
hero = Hero(name="Deadpond", secret_name="Dive Wilson")
add(hero)
```


To update a heroâ€™s age:
```python
update(id=1, age=50)
```

To delete a hero:
```python
delete(id=1)
```


Please replace id with the actual ID of the hero you wish to update or delete.

**Dependencies**
-   SQLModel
-   Starlette
-   PostgreSQL
-   Psycopg (PostgreSQL adapter)

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the application.
